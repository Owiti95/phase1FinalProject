# e-commerce site

## How it works

-The program uses html to structure the website.
-css is used for styling and manipilating the position and appearance(color) of the elements.
-Javascript has been used to add functionality to the website. Using DOM manipulation, it creates event listeners so as to 
-respond to user actions on the site. i.e clicking, submitting, scrolling.
